    <h2>The After-After-Party</h2>
    <p>Here&#8217;s our tentative plan for the first year of the rest of our lives:</p>
    <div class="rv"><img src="/assets/images/rv.png" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="party-content">
    <p>After the wedding, we&#8217;ll spend a long week in New Orleans and Austin &ndash; exploring, relaxing, and living it up in general. When we get back, it&#8217;ll be straight to work hunting down our ideal RV. We&#8217;ll fix that up this fall and winter (i.e. solar panels).</p>
    <p>Then, we hit the road.</p>
    <p>All of our things will go into storage, as we (Charlie and Maya included) head to music festival South by Southwest in Austin. From there, we&#8217;ll spend the next couple of months traveling this great, big country and working from wherever offers the best free wifi or the best views. On our list: Santa Fe, all of California, this little animal sanctuary in Oregon, Pine Ridge Reservation, New Orleans, Atlanta, Savannah, Brooklyn and wherever else we&#8217;re wanted.</p>
    <p>Eventually, we&#8217;ll make our way back to Chicago and start looking for our first home.</p>
